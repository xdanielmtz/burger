You will then choose on whether you have devoured the burger or not. Only then after you choose, you can add it.
Once added, it will go into one of the two columns available. The column on the left is for burgers you have not eaten and on the 
right column is for burgers you have eaten. Each burger on the list will have a remove button allowing you to do just that. The burger in 
the lists will also have a 'Eat' and 'Haven't Eaten' button depending on which column they are in.
